I am a product manager focused on innovations in healthcare data. In my current gig at the MGH & BWH Center for Clinical Data Science, I am working on integrating machine learning models into clinical workflows. I act as the bridge between our in-house scrum team and the clinicians and health IT administrators at the hospital. There are a lot of exciting technologies that could really make a difference in the healthcare industry, and all too often their impact is minimized due to beauracracy, technical illiteracy, or the complexities of legacy systems. I'm passionate about breaking down those walls so that patients can receive better care.

When I'm not writing product reqs or building slide decks, I am a voracious reader. I particularly enjoy history, biographies, and good old fashioned *whodunits*.
